# Shai: A Lightweight Facebook Messenger Alternative

**Shai** is a simple **Electron** app that wraps [Facebook Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/) and provides a lightweight, minimalist interface for chatting with your friends on Facebook. The app features a sleek dark theme and dynamic scrollbars similar to the ones in macOS.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to provide a simple and fast Messenger app that can be used mainly for chatting, without overwhelming users with a plethora of features and options. Unlike the official Facebook Messenger apps for Windows and macOS, which can be quite resource-intensive and slow to load, **Shai** aims to be a lightweight alternative that can run smoothly on any platform (although targeting Linux builds).
